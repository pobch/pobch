## Hi, I'm Pob 👻

### 🚧 Projects I’m currently working on

- ✏️ [**Diaaagram**](https://draw.crispyscript.com) - a diagram drawing app  
  ↳ for more details, please visit the repo: [react-diagram](https://github.com/pobch/react-diagram)
- 📗 [**CrispyScript**](https://crispyscript.com) - my personal website / blog  
  ↳ will open source soon

### ❤️ Technologies I love

- Typescript / Javascript  
  ↳ because `(null < 1) === true` is very intuitive 🙃
- React  
  ↳ because dealing with `useEffect()` is soooo much fun 🧨
- CSS  
  ↳ because everything in CSS is `!important` 🚀
