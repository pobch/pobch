## Hi, I'm Pob 👻

### 🚧 Projects I’m currently working on

- ✏️ **Diagram Drawing App**: [[Open the app] ↗](https://react-diagram.netlify.app)  
  ...for more details, please visit the repo: [react-diagram](https://github.com/pobch/react-diagram)

### ❤️ Technologies I love

- Typescript / Javascript  
  ↳ because `(null < 1) === true` is very intuitive 🙃
- React  
  ↳ because dealing with `useEffect()` is soooo much fun 🧨
- CSS  
  ↳ because everything in CSS is `!important` 🚀
